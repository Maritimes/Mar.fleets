\usage{
summarizer(
  data = NULL,
  units = "KGS",
  bySpp = TRUE,
  byYr = FALSE,
  byQuarter = FALSE,
  byGr = TRUE,
  byNAFO = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{default is \code{NULL}. This is the entire output from any of the fleet wrappers.}

\item{units}{default is \code{"KGS"}. This is the units you want weights returned in.  Valid
options are any of "KGS", "TONNES", "LBS".}

\item{bySpp}{default is \code{TRUE}. If TRUE, the summed weights and numbers of unique trips and
licence_ids will will be broken down by all identified landed species. If FALSE,aggregations will
ignore differences in landed species.}

\item{byYr}{default is \code{FALSE}.   If TRUE, the summed weights and numbers of unique trips
and licence_ids will will be broken down by each year in which a landing was identified. If FALSE,
aggregations will ignore differences in year. "Year" is taken from the end date of the associated
trip record (i.e. <data>$marf$MARF_SETS$T_DATE2 for MARF, and <data>$isdb$ISDB_SETS$DATE_TIME for
ISDB).}

\item{byQuarter}{default is \code{FALSE}.   If TRUE, the summed weights and numbers of unique trips
and licence_ids will will be broken down by each quarter in which a landing was identified. If FALSE,
aggregations will ignore differences in year. "Year" is taken from the end date of the associated
trip record (i.e. <data>$marf$MARF_SETS$T_DATE2 for MARF, and <data>$isdb$ISDB_SETS$DATE_TIME for
ISDB).}

\item{byGr}{default is \code{TRUE}. If TRUE, the summed weights and numbers of unique trips and
licence_ids will will be broken down by all identified gear types. If FALSE, aggregations will
ignore differences in gear types.}

\item{byNAFO}{default is \code{FALSE}.   If TRUE, the summed weights and numbers of unique trips
and licence_ids will will be broken down by <reported> NAFO division in which a landing was
identified. If FALSE, weights will be summed, irrespective of <reported> NAFO division.}

\item{byCust}{default is \code{NULL}. This can be the name of any field found in \code{<data>$marf$MARF_SETS}
by which you would like to see aggregated results}

\item{specMARF}{default is \code{NULL}.  If your data is for a fleet returns multiple species, you can
enter an MARFIS species code here, and the MARF data  will be limited to those species.}

\item{specISDB}{default is \code{NULL}.  If your data is for a fleet returns multiple species, you can
enter an ISDB species code here, and the ISDB data will be limited to those species.}

\item{doMARF}{default is \code{TRUE}. This indicates that the MARFIS results should be summarized.}

\item{doISDB}{default is \code{TRUE}. This indicates that the ISDB results should be summarized.}

\item{quietly}{default is \code{FALSE}. This specifies whether or not status messages should be
output to the console while the scripts run.}
}
\value{
by default, a list containing an object with the results of both MARF and ISDB is
returned.  If either \code{doMARF} or \code{doISDB} is set to FALSE, than the returned object is
a dataframe
}
\description{
This is a tool that quickly breaks down the results of any of the fleet
wrappers to provide information on the number of trips, unique vessels, unique licences, and total
catch.  These results can be further aggregated by Year, NAFO area, Species code, GEAR TYPE, as
well as by any fields that exist in the TRIPS or SETS object of the marfis or isdb results
(or both).
